# Common Utilities (common-utils)

Provides common utilities, Oh My Zsh!, and a non-root user setup on Arch Linux. Notably, the 'additionalPackages' option simplifies the inclusion of packages that would otherwise need separate features in non-Arch OS.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/bartventer/arch-devcontainer-features/common-utils:1": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| installZsh | Install ZSH? | boolean | true |
| additionalPackages | List of additional packages to install. Simplifies inclusion of packages that would otherwise need separate features in non-Arch OS. | string | - |
| configureZshAsDefaultShell | Change default shell to ZSH? | boolean | false |
| installOhMyZsh | Install Oh My Zsh!? | boolean | true |
| installOhMyZshConfig | Allow installing the default dev container .zshrc templates? | boolean | true |
| username | Enter name of a non-root user to configure or none to skip | string | automatic |
| userUid | Enter UID for non-root user | string | automatic |
| userGid | Enter GID for non-root user | string | automatic |

## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Arch Linux.

## Customizing the command prompt

By default, this script provides a custom command prompt that includes information about the git repository for the current folder. However, with certain large repositories, this can result in a slow command prompt due to the performance of needed git operations.

For performance reasons, a "dirty" indicator that tells you whether or not there are uncommitted changes is disabled by default. You can opt to turn this on for smaller repositories by entering the following in a terminal or adding it to your `postCreateCommand`:

```bash
git config devcontainers-theme.show-dirty 1
```

To completely disable the git portion of the prompt for the current folder's repository, you can use this configuration setting instead:

```bash
git config devcontainers-theme.hide-status 1
```

For `zsh`, the default theme is a [standard Oh My Zsh! theme](https://ohmyz.sh/). You may pick a different one by modifying the `ZSH_THEME` variable in `~/.zshrc`.
